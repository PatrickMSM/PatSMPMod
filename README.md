# THIS REPO IS ARCHIVED; I AM NO LONGER USING THIS MOD
# What is this mod?
This mod is made for PatSMP. It doesn't really do much, it only
* Checks resource packs
* Checks mod list and modpack
* Compares mod version

These are security measures made to protect the integrity of the modpack.

This mod alone won't do much, since it won't allow you to join servers if you don't have the right modpack, and won't allow you to use resource packs with the word "Xray" in them.

You can, however, turn this into YOUR OWN effective, non-invasive anti cheat and anti xray that blocks almost all hackers and cheaters. Just fork, or clone this repo, edit the list of mods permitted in the `Settings` class (you can also tweak other settings to your liking), build it and place the mod into the client **AND** into the server. Just remember, this only works with [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), and doesn't work with Bukkit and its forks (Spigot, Paper).

<sub><sup>Just keep in mind, hackers can fake this mod and cheat. This mod is not an anti cheat and not intended to be used as one. This mod may block skids with regular tools, but may not block more advanced hackers that can make their own mod that impersonates this one and allows them to cheat.</sub></sup>
# What is PatSMP?
PatSMP is a private minecraft SMP I made. It has a modpack for every player, that optimizes the game and makes it run much smoothly and also adds a [Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat) to the server.
# How do I use this mod?
First, this mod is useless on its own. If you really want to use it, follow these instructions:

Go to [Actions](https://github.com/PatrickMSM/PatSMPMod/actions), click the latest build run, download Artifacts, and extract patsmpmod-x.x.x.jar (NOT -sources-dev, -sources, -dev) into .minecraft/mods/, don't forget to use [fabric api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and run [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) with the newest version of minecraft and the newest version of the loader.
